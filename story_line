It was a dark and stormy night.
The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of sugarplums danced in their heads
Everyone was in a conference room on the 18th floor.
While Mama in her kerchief and I in my cap, had just settled (down?) for a long winter's nap.
Before a Friday the 13th.
